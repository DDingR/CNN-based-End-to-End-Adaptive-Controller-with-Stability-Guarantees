   journal = {IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems},
   volume = {53},
   number = {7},
   pages = {4216-4225},
   abstract = {In practice, steering wheel torque (SWT) control performance for an electric power steering (EPS) system may degrade owing to various reasons, such as model/parameter uncertainties and unpredictable large external disturbances (e.g., reaction force). Furthermore, the desired SWT suddenly varies and its sign also changes because the direction of the steering wheel angle (SWA) often changes according to the driver. In this article, a neural network (NN) approximation-based adaptive nonlinear control (ANC) using reinforced gain (RG) for an EPS system is proposed to resolve the above-mentioned problems using an SWT model. The proposed control method employs an NN approximator, ANC, and RG. The NN approximator is designed to estimate the unknown complex nonlinear function in EPS modeling. The ANC is designed via backstepping to compensate for parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. Further, the RG is designed as a positive nonlinear function of the error to sufficiently suppress the error according to variations in the desired SWT and external disturbance. The RG increases to suppress the error at a rapid transient response, owing to the sudden change in the sign of the desired SWT and the external disturbance. Thus, a high gain (increased RG) is used only when necessary so that an unnecessarily high gain can be avoided.},

   abstract = {In this paper, a direct adaptive controller is developed based on multilayer neural networks (MNNs) for a class of nonlinear systems. The proposed scheme avoids the possible singularity problem of the controller usually met in adaptive control design. The system tracking error is proven to converge to a small neighborhood of zero, while the stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. The transient performance of the resulting adaptive system is analytically quantified, and an example is given to show the effectiveness of the scheme. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.
